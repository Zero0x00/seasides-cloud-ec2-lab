            <h2>Vulnerability</h2>
<p>
    SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) is a dangerous web vulnerability caused by poor programming practices. SSRF allows attackers to send requests from the server to other resources.
    Attackers typically use SSRF attacks to target internal systems that are behind firewalls and are not accessible from the external network.

    <h3>How SSRF Works:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The attacker identifies an application where a URL can be imported or where data is read from a URL.</li>
        <li>The attacker attempts to modify the URL by providing a different URL or manipulating the existing one.</li>
        <li>Once the manipulated URL is sent to the server, the server-side code tries to read data from the manipulated URL, allowing the attacker to potentially access services.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Prevent SSRF:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Never trust user input.</li>
        <li>Implement whitelisting of domains and IP addresses.</li>
        <li>Enable authentication on all services.</li>
        <li>Sanitize and validate inputs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>SSRF Payloads:</h3>

    <h4>SSRF with Blacklisted-Based Input Filters</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit a product page, click "Check stock," and intercept the request in Burp Suite, then send it to Burp Repeater.</li>
        <li>Change the URL in the "stockApi" parameter to "http://127.0.0.1/" and observe that the request is blocked.</li>
        <li>Bypass the block by changing the URL to "http://127.1/".</li>
        <li>Change the URL to "http://127.1/admin" and observe that the URL is blocked again.</li>
        <li>Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to "%2561" to access the admin interface and delete the target user.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>SSRF with Filter Bypass via Open Redirection Vulnerability</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit a product page, click "Check stock," and intercept the request in Burp Suite, then send it to Burp Repeater.</li>
        <li>Try tampering with the "stockApi" parameter and observe that it isn't possible to make the server issue the request directly to a different host.</li>
        <li>Click "next product" and observe that the "path" parameter is placed into the Location header of a redirection response, resulting in an open redirection.</li>
        <li>Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability and redirects to the admin interface, then provide this URL as the "stockApi" parameter on the stock checker: "/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin".</li>
        <li>Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.</li>
        <li>Amend the path to delete the target user: "/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos".</li>
    </ol>
